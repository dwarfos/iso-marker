TESTED on:

- Windows (10)
- Ubuntu (18LTS/20LTS/21)
- Fedora (something very old?)

Run:

- `npm run gui`
- `npm run cli`

Note:

- Fedora has a minor GUI glitch (progressBar) that has no influence whatsoever. Can NOT be reproduced in Win or Ubuntu.
- GUI needs some tuning in overall due to different OS DE rendering defaults.

TODO:

- Add screenshots and some general doc.
- Complete cli.
